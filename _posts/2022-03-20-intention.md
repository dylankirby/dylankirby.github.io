title: "On being intentional"
---

3 Months into my time as a team lead I read an article that layed out the authors leadership plan for 2021. In reading this article, and thinking about it for days after, I came to the realization that the writer was doing something I wasn't as a leader... being intentional as a leader. Sure I would deal with problems from the engineers on my team when they came to me, and I would support their goals if they brought them to me, but I wasn't being proactive in support their development.

In my role as a developer, I've always preached the value of being intentional in every choice we make, from the reasoning for changing a model, to the reason for choosing a certain debugging pathway over another. Quite often I see people make decisions without any rationale, they are simply replaying a script they learned once in a previous situation, or that they read in the documentation about a previous incident, and while these mental shortcuts serve us well, I've always prefered to be aware of the reasons I did X instead of Y, and to choose my path intentionally, even if it is a mental shortcut.

I realized that this habit I depend on so heavily as an engineer was something I could and should be applying as a lead, being intentional with leading this group of people, of doing more than reacting to their needs and goals, but to help actively shape them based what I see day to day, and how they themselves want to develop. 

It was at that point that I decided to sit down and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the developers on my team, and set out a list of areas of improvement for them, as well areas where they already excelled. I sat down the each one of them, and spent the time to have the conversation about their own goals, their stengths and weaknesses. Coming out of that meeting we both had very clear ideas of what they needed to focus on this year, and what opportunities would help get them there. 

As we progressed through the year, this knowledge proved invaluable in knowing when to delegate certain tasks to each of them, giving some people documentation tasks to improve their communication skills, and giving others control of a small project (and stepping back to make space for them to own it) to plan, organize, and execute on. 

This style of leadership feels like a lot more work than it did to be passive, it takes mental energy to get the ball rolling, to get people to engage and share their goals, to give them meaningful feedback, and craft a years long plan to grow their skillset, but it's necessary.

But an organization whose managers cannot reach their employees on this level will always be lagging... because their promotions, their employee's growth, their developers engagement, will always be left completely to chance. Some will rise some will fall, some will leave, some will join. That company takes very little action to develop people to grow in the company the way they company needs them. They do little to engage with and stoke their employees intrinsic motivation. They do little to build and retain employees who want to grow their skills, which covers most engineers I've ever met.

Yet there is another path, one of being intentional with how we lead our teams, how we intentionally develop and shape the careers of their careers. Be the coach, that observes from a distance and gives feedback often, that creates room for people to grow into, to let them try their skills out and start gaining confidence they can handle that next big project.

Even as someone who might not be in a leadership position, you too can lead intentionally. To evalutate the reasons why you make choice X instead of Y, to udnerstand your default choices, even when they are correct, to be able to explain them, to each others. The more you act intentionally, the deeper your own understanding develops.
