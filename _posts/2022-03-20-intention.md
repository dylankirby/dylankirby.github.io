title: "On being intentional"
---

3 Months into my time as a team lead I read an article that layed out the authors leadership plan for 2021. 

In reading this article, and thinking about it for days after, I came to the realization that the writer was doing something I wasn't as a leader... being intentional. Sure I would deal with problems from the engineers on my team when they came to me, and I would support their goals if they brought them to me, but I wasn't being proactive in supporting their development.

## Being intentional as an Engineer

In my role as a engineer, I've always preached the value of being intentional in every choice we make, from the reasoning for changing a model, to the reason for choosing a certain debugging pathway over another. Quite often I see people make decisions without any rationale, they are simply replaying a script they learned once in a previous situation, or that they read in the documentation about a previous incident, and while these mental shortcuts serve us well, I've always prefered to be aware of the reasons I did X instead of Y, and to choose my path intentionally, even if it is a mental shortcut.

The benefits of being intentional as an engineer are clear, you develop a very clear cut understanding of your motivations for decisions. By extention, having those motivations in mind allows you to fully think them through and understand if they are in fact relevant to the problem you are solving, or if you're simply going down a familiar path. 

Further, having a clear picture in your mind of your motivations allows you to easily explain them to others, helping them to understand and learn from you, while also being able to critique your thought process and produce the most optimal solution to the problem at hand.

## Being intentional as a leader

I realized that this habit I depend on so heavily as an engineer was something I could and should be applying as a lead, being intentional with leading this group of people, of doing more than reacting to their needs and goals, but to help actively shape them based what I see day to day, and how they themselves want to develop. 

It was at that point that I decided to sit down and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the developers on my team, and set out a list of areas of improvement for them, as well areas where they already excelled. I sat down the each one of them, and spent the time to have the conversation about their own goals, their stengths and weaknesses. Coming out of that meeting we both had very clear ideas of what they needed to focus on this year, and what opportunities would help get them there. 

As we progressed through the year, this knowledge proved invaluable in knowing when to delegate certain tasks to each of them, giving some people documentation tasks to improve their communication skills, and giving others control of a small project (and stepping back to make space for them to own it) to plan, organize, and execute on.

I like to call this Delegating With Intention. No matter how you are as a leader, you are no doubt delegating tasks to the your team, but knowing their career goals allows you to delegate in a way that supports both your need to have tasks done, and their desire to feel like they are making meaningful progress in their career.

## Why bother??

It's a fair question to ask why we should put all this effort in... being intentional as an engineer takes time and effort to understand, rationalize, and convey your motivations for each and every technical decision. It effectively takes you off autopilot and makes you hyper aware of what you are doing.

The same can be said of applying this concept as a leader, it times engery to build the initial momentum of getting people engaged in their own growth, of working with them and spending time mentoring them throughout the projects they take on.

I'm sure all of us have felt a time like we are on autopilot in our day to day lives... maybe you're driving home after a long day, on a familiar road, and don't really remember all the turns you took. Maybe you sit in the same room as our partner, but instead of being with them intentionally, you are passive, you both sit on your phones and don't interact. 

Nobody likes to live this way but it is comfortable.

And yet, with a bit of purpose and hard work, we can bring intention to our day to day work an generate far better outcomes in the code we write, the skills we develop, and the growth we nurture in our team members
