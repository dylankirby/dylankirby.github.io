title: "On being self taught"
---

When I chose one day to teach myself to write code, and get a job in the tech industry, I had no idea how long the road was, or what it would take in order to get into the industry without a CS degree, but I chose it nevertheless. I knew I had education in Mathematics, was damn good at it, and that if I could figure that out, I could do this. 

Working full time as an academic tutor for Math and Science, I started dedicating a few hours every week to going through an introductory udemy course. I had done one CS class at university but couldn't recall a single thing they taught us. I started with a full stack Node JS course, which took me some 8 months to get through fully. At this point I know a good amount, although only in one context, so I set out to learn Python.

A few years after that journey began, I had secured myself an internship with a local tech company through a reference, but I was constantly nervous that there was some gap in my knowledge that would mean I wouldn't be able to contribute to their code base. Even with the years of time I had put into learning, and the projects I had build, I still figured that the people working here were professionals, with degrees and years of experience that would mean I would be so far behind.

The reality I found was very different, some of my coworkers had degrees, some were fully self taught, but one thing every had in common was that... well... every one is teaching themselves everyday. Software Development is not a process where you go to school and then you know everything, instead you may only know the basics of how to build a platform and write code from school, but the industry is massive, and you need to be learning everyday to keep up.

The main point I took out of this is that, while I certainly had gaps in my knowledge from my lack of CS education, they would only hold me back if I didn't learn those lessons intentionally. I could make up for those gaps with a bit of effort and it would never keep me from progressing in my career... and damn that felt good.

At that point I took on the mindset I think every engineer should have.

Always be learning.

We all know our weaknesses or new concepts/technologies we want to learn, but how many of us drive ourselves towards learning them.
