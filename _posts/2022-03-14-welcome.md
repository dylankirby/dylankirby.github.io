Welcome!

This blog will be home to all my crazy ideas, ranging from techincal topics like Python Context Managers, to topics relevant to leading teams, mentoring others, and occasioanlly some thoughts on organizational patterns and practices that encourage or inhibit great product development.

As a self taught developer who spent time running business before stepping into the role, I try to see the act of creating software hollistically, balancing the technical realities with the business realities, and trying to align the interestes of both sides of the coin to enable radical engineering feats.
